                Are you struggling to lose weight no matter how much you diet or exercise?
                Turns out, <span>it's not your fault.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2022 study published in Nature MediCine of 52,000 women and men, the
                largest of its kind in humans, found just one common factor in every
                overweight man and woman. <span>Low brown adipose tissue levels!</span> They also found common in every
                skinny person were high brown adipose tissue
                levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brown adipose tissue (BAT) also know as brown fat, is not fat at all. Its not a fat storer but a
                <span>fat shrinker. </span>Its brown color comes from its densely packed mitochondria which work
                24/7 to <span>burn calories</span> from your fat stores and the food you eat into pure, natural energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though BAT makes up a fraction of your weight, it can burn up to <span>300
                    times</span> more calories than any other cell in your body.
